## Code of conduct
1. Care the docs
2. Keep the code clean
3. We use [centralized workflow](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows):
  - Don't edit the mainbranch. Use pull requests instead (if nobody reacts we're probably still mixing - find us on stage) 
  - If you need an own different setup, fork this repo
