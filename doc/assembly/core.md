# AÂ³ Core Assembly
## Hardware
- i5 quadcore with 3.2Ghz per Core
- ssd
- 8G Ram
- soundhardware could be everything what runs on linux. We use rme hdsp9652 because its cheap and works good for 24 analog io. We plugged a bunch of behringer dcx2496 behind and clocked it with a rosendahl nanoclock (64samples per package, 44100Hz, 16bit, 2.8ms roundtrip latency)
