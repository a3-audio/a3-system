# AÂ³ Core Assembly
## Hardware
Audiohardware could be everything what runs on linux.

### We tested the following setups:

#### miniDSP USBStreamer (up to 8 audio io)
- i5 quadcore 3.2Ghz
- ssd
- 8G Ram
- Behringer ADA8000
- 44100Hz, 16bit, 2.8ms roundtrip latency

#### - RME HDSP9652 pci (up to 24 audio io)
- i5 quadcore 3.2Ghz
- ssd
- 8G Ram
- One of the cheapest, but old audio-pci-card is the rme hdsp9652. Its cheap and works good for 24 analog io. We plugged a bunch of Behringer ADA8000 behind and clocked it with a rosendahl nanoclock (44100Hz, 16bit, 2.8ms roundtrip latency)
