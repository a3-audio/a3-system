## Software-Architecture
A³ Core, A³ Mix, A³ Motion are connected via lan to the same network.
On each device runs a pythonscript which sends and receives OSC (Open Sound Control).

- A³ Core: [[Ambijockey/doc/development/core]]
- A³ Mix: [[Ambijockey/doc/development/mic]]
- A³ Motion: [[Ambijockey/doc/development/moc]]
- OSC: [[osc]]
- Flash Teensy: [[flashTeensy]]

## Next steps
- Migrate audioengine from reaper to supercollider
- Modularize channelstrips on A³ Mix
- Adding functions to A³ Motion
