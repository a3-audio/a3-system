# A³ Pandemic Development
## Git
We use the centralized workflow, description [here](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows)

1. Don't edit the main branch. Use pull requests instead (if nobody reacts we're probably still mixing - find us on stage)
2. If you need an own different setup, forck this repo

[A³motion](https://github.com/ambisonics-audio-association/Ambijockey/blob/main/Controller_Motion/README.md)
[A³motion UI](https://github.com/ambisonics-audio-association/MotionControllerUI)

## Blackboard
We organize our tasks in a [github-project](https://github.com/orgs/ambisonics-audio-association/projects/1)

### Code of conduct
1. Don't panic
2. Care the docs
3. Keep the code clean
4. Eastereggs are welcome!
