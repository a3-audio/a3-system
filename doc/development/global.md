# A³ Pandemic Development
## Git
We use centralized workflow:
https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows

1. Don't edit the main branch. Use pull requests instead (if nobody reacts we're probably still mixing - find us on stage)
2. If you need an own different setup, forck this repo

A³ Pandemic Mainrepo:
