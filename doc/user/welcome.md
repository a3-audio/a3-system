# A³ Pandemic
3D-Sound Dj-Setup with Live-Panning-Interface

## Design
A³ Pandemic is designed as dj-setup with 4 stereo input-channels and a tape-in for multichannel input. It is scalable and cappable to load tons of speakers in multiple 3d-soundspheres.

It consits of three devices:

### A³ Core (The Soundserver)
A³ Core processes analog audiosignals, calculates 3d-soundspheres and is remotecontrolled by A³ Mix and A³ Motion (or any other osc-controller). A³ Core can handle a wide range of audiohardware to fit environments like dante, madi or any class-compliant. A³ Core runs safe and stable below 3 ms input-to-output-latency.
Audiohardware is the limit.
 
### A³ Mix (The DJ-Mixer)
A³ Mix is a DJ-Mixer with 3-band-kill-eq, fx-section for hi- and lopass, 3d-toggle, multichannel vu-meter and 3d-prelisten for headphones.

### A³ Motion (The Motion-Sampler)
A³ Motion records motion from touchscreen, stores them on samplepads and plays them back as loop, onshot or different mode. A³ Motion handles looplength, it syncs to bpm-clock, spread stereowidth and boost side from mid/side processing.
It is designed to pan tracks while scratching. Live dynamic audio motion in a 3d-soundsphere - Brainwashing.
